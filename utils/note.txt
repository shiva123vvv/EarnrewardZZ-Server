const db = require('../utils/db');

// In Hybrid mode, the models are instantiated with logic that checks db.isJson
// However, the `checkConnection` happens later.
// We need to ensure models use the correct logic.
// Hack: We'll make defineModel return a proxy that delegates to either Sequelize or JsonCollection
// based on the runtime flag.

// Let's rewrite db.js one last time to be perfect.
